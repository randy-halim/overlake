# Overlake Composite Squadron Discord Bot

Features user linking to personal records to automatically update roles, A "dm-like" experience with logging for CPP, and other moderation features. Intended to reduce human admin contact with the server for CPP purposes.

# TODO

- [ ] Discord Bot Container
- [ ] Message Log "Server"
- [ ] Web Portal to link account and other admin stuff
- [ ] Background service to track and auto-update roles

The plan is to use a "docker-compose" system for each container to communicate with each other, breaking the project into smaller services.
